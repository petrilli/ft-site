# Funcatron

Serverless on Your Cluster:

* Define endpoints in Swagger
* Write functions in Java, Scala, Clojure, Python, or JavaScript
* Deploy to Mesos, Kubernets, or Swarm
* Scale automatically

_Funcatron let's you deploy serverless on any cloud provider or in your
private cloud. Focus on the functions, avoid vendor lock-in._

This document sets out the goals for the [Funcatron](http://funcatron.org) project.

## What is Funcatron?

Amazon's [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) popularized
["serverless"](http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html)
code deployment. It's simple and clean: associate a function with an event.
Each time the event happens, the function is applied and the function's
return value is returned to the event source. An event could be an HTTP(S)
request, something on an event queue, whatever.

Functions are ephemeral. They existing for the duration of the function call.
Once the function returns a value, all of its state and scope and everything
else about it is assumed to go away. While this might sound like a disadvantage,
it has some big advantages.

Scaling this kind of architecture is simple. The lack of state between function 
calls means the more frequently a function gets applied, the more compute 
resources that can allocated to support the function
and [Bob's Your Uncle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob%27s_your_uncle). 

The current popular serverless infrastructures (competitors to Amazon's Lambda) are
proprietary: when you write to the API for Lambda or Google's
[Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/),
_**you're locked into that vendor**_. 
There's currently no (well, there's [OpenWhisk](https://developer.ibm.com/openwhisk/))
generic way to do the auto-scale function thing on a private cloud or in a
way that can migrate between, or span, multiple cloud providers and internal 
infrastructure.

Funcatron addresses this. Funcatron provides a cloud-provider-neutral mechanism for
developing, testing, and deploying auto-scalable functions. Funcatron is designed 
to run on multiple container orchestration clusters:
[Mesos](https://mesosphere.com/), [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/), or
[Docker Swarm](https://docker.com).

## Software Lifecycle

Software goes through a lifecycle:

- Authoring
- Testing
- Staging
- Production
- Debugging

Funcatron addresses software at each stage of the lifecycle.

### Authoring

An engineers sits down to write software. The faster the turn-around between
code written and "trying it out," the more productive the engineer will be.

Funcatron supports a "save, reload" model where the engineer saves a file
(presuming they're using an IDE that does compilation on save or are using a
non-compiled language), and their function endpoints are available. That's it.
No uploading. No reconfiguration. No waiting. The endpoint is available on save.

Further, the Funcatron model requires knowledge of two things:

* [Swagger](http://swagger.io)
* How to write a simple function in Java, Scala, Clojure, Python, or JavaScript.

**That's it.**

The engineer defines the endpoints in Swagger and uses the `operationId` to
specify the function (or class for Java and Scala) to apply when then endpoint
is requested. Funcatron takes care of the rest.

Between the fast turn-around and low "new stuff to learn" quotient,
it's easy to get started with Funcatron. It's also easy to stay productive
with Funcatron.

Also, developers need only have Docker installed on their development machine
to live-test Funcatron code.

### Testing

Because Funcatron endpoints are single functions (or methods on newly
instantiated classes), writing unit tests is simple. Write a unit test and
test the function.

### Staging

Funcatron code bundles (Funcs) contain a Swagger endpoint definition and the
functions
that are associated with the endpoint and any library code. For JVM languages,
these are bundled into an Uber JAR. For Python, a
[PEX](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex)
file. The Swagger definitions for an endpoint are unique based on
host name and root path.

Funcatron supports performing [`sed`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed) operations
on Swagger fields based on environment variables. This allows rewriting host name,
root path, and other Swagger fields if the Func is deployed to a staging (or test)
server. Thus, there's one deployment unit (a Func bundle) that have well defined
behaviors across test, staging, and production servers.

### Production

Funcatron allows simple deployment and rollback of end-point collections
defined in Swagger files and implemented in a JVM language, Python, or NodeJS.

Requests are forwarded from Nginx via a message queue to a dispatcher (a Tron).
Based on the hostname and root path, the message is placed on a queue for
a specific Func. The Func processes the request and sends the response
to a reply queue. The Nginx process dequeues the response and returns
it as an HTTP response.

The number of Func instances running on a cluster is based on the queue depth
and response time. The Func manager sends statistics back to the Trons
and the Trons change Func allocation based on these statistics by
communicating with the container orchestration substrate (Mesos, Kubernetes,
Swarm) and changing the allocation of Func running containers.

From the DevOps point of view: deploy a Func and it binds to the appropriate
HTTP endpoint and scales to handle load.

### Debugging & Test Cases

Funcatron logs a unique request ID and the SHA of the Func with every log line
related to a request. This allows correlation of requests as they fan out through
a cluster.

Funcatron allows dynamic changing log levels on a Func-by-Func basis which allows
capturing more information on demand.

All communications between the front end, Funcs, and back again are via well
defined JSON payloads. Funcatron allows capturing request and response
payloads on a Func-by-Func basis (complete streams, or random sampling).
This data can be used for testing or debugging.

## Architecture

Funcatron has some ambitious goals and has an architecture to facilitate
achieving these goals.

In all but development mode, Funcatron runs on a Docker container orchestration
system: Mesos, Kubernetes, or Docker Swarm. We call this the "container
substrate." Each of the Funcatron components can be scaled independently with
messages to the container substrate.

For HTTP requests, Funcatron uses Nginx and Lua (via the
[OpenResty](http://openresty.org/en/) project) to handle the HTTP requests.
A small
Lua script encodes the request as a payload that's sent to a message broker
(initially RabbitMQ, but this will be pluggable, e.g. Kafka). For large
request or response bodies, the body will be written to a shared distributed
filesystem (e.g., HDFS) and a reference to the file will be enqueued.
For all but the highest volume installations, 2 Nginx instances
should be sufficient.

A "Tron" module dequeues the request. Based on the queue depth
for the "request firehose", the container substrate can launch more Trons.

Based on the combination of `host` and `pathPrefix` attributes in the Swagger
module definition, the Tron enqueues the request on the appropriate queue.

A Runner module dequeues messages from a number of host/pathPrefix queues and
forwards the request to the appropriate Func. The runner then takes the function
return value and appropriately encodes it and places it on the reply queue which
dequeued by the original endpoint.

Each Func can run multiple modules. Based on queue depth, queue service time,
and CPU usage stats from the Funcs, more runners can be allocated on the substrate,
or more Funcs can be allocated across the runners.

The Lua scripts dequeues the response and turns in into an Nginx response.

Because all of the operation of the Funcs and Trons can be captured as messages
(and all the messages are in JSON), it's possible to capture message streams for
testing and debugging purposes.

Every request has a unique ID and each log line includes the unique ID so it's
possible to correlate a request as it moves across the cluster.

### Notes

The initial implementation uses Nginx/OpenResty, RabbitMQ, Java/Scala, and Mesos
to support HTTP requests. This is not "hardcoded" but pluggable. Specifically:

* Anything that can enqueue a payload and dequeue the response can
  work with the rest of Funcatron. The initial implementation is HTTP via
  Nginx/OpenResty, but nothing in the rest of the system depends on what enqueues
  the request and dequeues the response.
* RabbitMQ is the initial message broker, but it could be Kafka or any other
  message broker. This is pluggable.
* Initially, dispatch from Runners to Funcs will be Java/Scala classes. But the
  dispatch is also pluggable so other languages (Clojure) and
  runtimes (Python, NodeJS) will be supported.
* "But Swagger is HTTP only" well... yes and no... the verb and the scheme are
  HTTP-specific, but they can be ignored... and by the time the request is
  dequeued by the Runner, the origin (HTTP or something else) of the message
  is irrelevant. The power of Swagger is two-fold:
  * Excellent definitions of incoming and outgoing data shapes
  * Great tooling and lots of general Swagger skills

Because everything in Funcatron is asynchronous messages, how the messages are
passed, where the message originate and where responses are dequeued are all
pluggable and irrelevant to the other parts of the system.

The key idea in Funcatron is the Func is a well defined bundle of functionality
that's associated with a particular message signature that maps to well HTTP via
host, pathPrefix, path, and verb, but could map to something else.

It may be possible to chain Func invocations. I don't yet have a concrete
design, but rather than enqueuing a Func return value as a response, it may
be possible to package it as a request (the request body contains the Func
return value) and forwarding it to another Func for further processing.

Finally, if there's no `reply-to` field in a message, the Func is applied (invoked)
but the results are discarded. This allows for side effects from the Func
rather than just computation.

## Project Status

The project is in the initial development phase. Java and Scala Func bundles
